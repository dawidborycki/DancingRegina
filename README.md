## Description
This is a mobile AR app created with Unity and Vuforia. The app shows how to quickly create AR experience by attaching digital character to the image target.

## Usage
1. Get the Oxygen image from [here](https://github.com/dawidborycki/DancingRegina/blob/master/Assets/Editor/Vuforia/ForPrint/ImageTargets/target_images_USLetter.pdf). This image serves as the target. You can either print out the image or display it on your smartphone. 
2. Run the app
3. Hold up the image in front of the camera. Vuforia will
recognize the target and display the 3D dancing character on top of it. (See Figures below)
