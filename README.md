## DancingRegina
This is a mobile AR app created with Unity and Vuforia. The app shows how to quickly create AR experience by attaching digital character to the image target.

## Usage
1. Run the app
2. You need some way to place the image target (Oxygen image) in the real world. There are a couple
ways to do this. You can either print out the image or display it on your smartphone. 
3. You can get the Oxygen image from [here](https://github.com/dawidborycki/DancingRegina/blob/master/Assets/Editor/Vuforia/ForPrint/ImageTargets/target_images_USLetter.pdf) 
4. Hold up the image (either the printout or your smartphone) in front of the camera. Vuforia will
recognize the target and display the 3D dancing character on top of it. (See Figures below)
